htmlsane, an HTML/xhtml sanitizer in pure PHP.

It is unclear if I will finish this, but large parts are done and it would
be a shame to see the code go to waste.  I'm hoping someone else will find
it useful, and perhaps even finish it.

generate/generate.php takes a Relax NG format DTD, and outputs a table/tree
usable by the validater (in validate/).

You may test what's done with validate/validate.php
Currently it handles elements and non-complex attributes, mostly.

validate.php: Example use of the htmlsane class(es).

Config.php: Base configuration.

Cursor.php: Keeps track of the position in the lexical representation,
	depth in the parser, and other miscellaneous global things.

Lexer.php: Turns raw [html/xhtml] text in to symbols.  Not strict.

ParseData.php: Sanitizes xml data types (attributes, text, etc).

Parse.php: Turns symbols from Lexer in to valid output.  Garbage in, XHTML out.

Css.php: Lexer/parser for css.  Incomplete.  Currently unused.

uri.php: URI parser/validater/normalization, mostly complete.

util.php: Random text-related utility functions for dealing with UTF-8.

debug.php: Utility functions for outputting useful debug info.
	Not for production use.

xhtml11-ents.php: Generated table of xhtml entities

xhtml11.php: Generated table for Parse.php; generated by generate.php.
